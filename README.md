# Advert Dashboard

A simple dashboard to check the running campaing/reports for clicks, impression, and installs

For demo, follow this [link](https://zaidrashid.github.io/advert)

Setup
-----

You will need the latest NPM and Node. And run `npm install` to install all the packages. 

This project uses gulp to build the distribution files. (In this case, I put it as docs for github pages purposes)

The following command explains:

* `npm run build` :  Wil build the repo and produce `.build/` and `docs/`

Framework
---------

This project uses AngularJS 1.7.7. Other main dependencies:

* [angular-ui-grid](http://ui-grid.info/) : for table generation
* [Chartist JS](http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/index.html): for chart generation
